To make 1M Tris Buffer

Procedure: 

1. Dissolve 121.1 g of Tris base in 800 ml of H2O. 
2. Adjust pH to 8.0 by adding 42 ml of concentrated HCL in the fume hood with a glass pipette. 
3. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature before making the final adjustments to the pH.
4. Adjust the volume to 1 L with H20.
5. Split in to two bottles to autoclave so that it doesnâ€™t overflow. 
6. ONLY autoclave if you have been fully trained on how to do so.

To make SB Buffer (20X Stock Solution)

1. Weigh out 8 g NaOH pellets in a weigh boat
2. Add 900mL of DI water to a 1L bottle
3. Add the NaOH to the bottle
4. Weigh out 47g Boric Acid pellets (mw 61.83)
5. Add to bottle with water and NaOH
6. Add a stir bar and put it on the magnetic stirrer to dissolve. 
After all the particles are dissolved bring up to 1000ml.  Final solution should be around pH 8.2

To make 1X SB Buffer, dilute 50ml of 20X SB buffer into 950ml of ddH20 
This 1X is to use with running gels and making agarose gels
