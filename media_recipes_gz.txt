---------------

Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) 
---------------
1000 mL Distilled water  
4.0 g Potato starch 
20.0 g Glucose  
15.0 g Agar 

A general purpose sporulation medium available commercially (Difco). 
Preparation Suspend 39 g of powdered medium in 1 L water. Autoclave at 121C /15 minutes.  

---------------

Corn Meal Agar
---------------
Cornmeal (yellow) 50 g 
Agar 15 g 
Distilled water 1 L 

A nutritionally deficient medium used to promote sporulation, 
especially in ascomycetes and some dematiaceous hyphomycetes 
Preparation: Mix cornmeal in 500 ml water. Heat for one hour in a 52 C waterbath. 
Filter through cheesecloth (filtrate does not need to be clear). 
Discard cornmeal residue. Bring volume of filtrate up to 1000 ml. Divide into 2 1L flasks. 
Add 7.5 g of agar to each flask. Boil to dissolve agar. Autoclave  121C/15 minutes

---------------

Malt Extract Agar (MEA)
---------------

1000 mL dH2O
20 g Malt Extract
2 g Yeast Extract
0.75 g Potassium Phosphate (Monobasic)

Autoclave at 121 C for 20 minutes
Allow to cool to below 80 C

Add the following antibiotics (filter-sterilized):

Streptomycin [30 ug/mL]
Kanamycin [30 ug/mL]

*Antibiotic stocks are in fridge and freezer, stored at [50 mg/mL]
*Add 150 uL of each antibiotic for every 500 mL of media you are making.

-------------

Weak Malt Extract Agar (wMEA)
-------------

1000 mL dH2O
15 g Bacto Agar
1 g Yeast Extract
2 g Malt Extract
1 g Dextrose
0.75 g Dibasic Potassium Phosphate


Autoclave at 121 C for 20 minutes in loosely-capped jars (leave plenty of headspace to prevent boilover)
Allow to cool to below 80 C

Add the following antibiotics (filter-sterilized):

Streptomycin [30 ug/mL]
Kanamycin [50 ug/mL]

-------------

V8 wMEA Agar (V8 wMEA) - Useful to induce sexuality/sporulation in various fungi
-------------

substitute 180 mL of dH2O from wMEA Agar recipe for 1 small can of regular V8 (180 mL)
same as wMEA otherwise

-------------

"Leaf Agar"
-------------
(Used to include "magical" leaf components to isolate tricky enophytic fungi)

200 g fresh leaf material, preferrably from host of interest
wMEA agar ingredients

Steep leaves in 500-800 mL of dH2O in a flask set into a hot water bath at 65 C for 1 hour
Strain leaf matter and squeeze leaves to extract as much liquid as possible
Add dH2O to make 1000 mL and use as liquid for standard wMEA Agar

-------------
